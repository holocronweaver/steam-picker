A Python 3 CLI for picking a random game from your Steam library!

* Features
- customizable filters (co-op, multiplayer, VR, high Metacritic rating, and more!)
- concise game metadata (summary, platforms, categories, playtime, Metacritic score, etc.)
* Installation
Requires Python 3.4 or higher.

~python3 setup.py install --user~

Feel free to omit the ~--user~ flag if you normally install packages
to the root directory.

Once this package matures I plan to add it to PyPi.
* Usage
Assuming your Python bin is in your ~$PATH~, just run ~steam-picker~ from the command line.

#+begin_src bash
Pick a game from your personal Steam library!
